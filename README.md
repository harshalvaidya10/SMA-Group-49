<b>Determining TED Talk popularity on youtube - </b>

<b>Problem Statement</b>

Just about everyone has watched a TED talk at some point in their lives. These seemingly ubiquitous presentations are free and easily shared online through social media, and shown in schools, offices, and other meetings. TED Talks have grown so popular over the years that they are seen as the gold standard of modern presentations, in both the business and consumer realms. Talks stand out from other forms of presentations as an effective medium to convey accurate, easy-to-understand information to a target audience. 
We will determine the popularity of the ted talk based on the parameters such as the occupation leading to the most popular talks on average, the number of comments and translation languages, and the day of the week the video is uploaded.
